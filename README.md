# MotW Tools

A suite of Windows utilities for viewing, adding, or removing **Mark-of-the-Web (MotW)** metadata from files.

## Executive Summary

Microsoft’s recent security updates (notably Windows 11 25H2 / KB5070960) expanded enforcement of the Mark-of-the-Web feature, preventing the preview of downloaded files and adding additional safety prompts.
While this change improves protection against credential leaks and malicious file execution, it also creates real productivity friction for trusted internal documents.

**MotW Tools** provides a safe, auditable way to manage this metadata for files originating from trusted sources.
The suite includes:

| Component      | Type                  | Description                                                                                  |
| -------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **MotWasher**  | GUI Application (WPF) | Provides a graphical interface for batch inspection and removal of MotW metadata.            |
| **MotWatcher** | System Tray Service   | Background file watcher that automatically removes MotW from monitored directories.          |
| **MotW.ps1**   | PowerShell Script     | Lightweight command-line and "Send To" integration for quick unblocking without UI overhead. |

All tools operate per-user and require no administrative rights.

## Overview

When Windows detects a file downloaded from the Internet, it appends a small hidden stream named `Zone.Identifier` that flags the file as **Zone 3 (Internet)**.
This metadata:
- Disables file previews in Explorer and Outlook
- Triggers additional warning prompts
- Blocks some scripts or macros from running

MotW Tools modifies only this metadata; the original file contents and hashes remain unchanged.

| --------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `unblock` | Removes MotW metadata (default).              |
| `add`     | Adds MotW metadata (`ZoneId=3`).              |
| `status`  | Displays `[MotW]` or `[clean]` for each file. |

**Common Parameters**
| Parameter  | Description                                           |

| `-WhatIf`  | Show what would happen without making changes.        |
| `-Confirm` | Prompt for confirmation before each file operation.   |
| `-Verbose` | Display detailed operation information.               |

**Examples**
```powershell
# Unblock all PDFs in current folder
MotW.ps1 *.pdf

# Check status of all files recursively
MotW.ps1 status . -Recurse

# Add MotW metadata back to executables
MotW.ps1 add *.exe

# Preview unblock operation without making changes
MotW.ps1 unblock *.docx -WhatIf

# Unblock with confirmation prompts
MotW.ps1 unblock *.pdf -Confirm
```

**Logs:**
All PowerShell operations are logged to:
- `%LOCALAPPDATA%\MotW\motw.log` (MotW.ps1 operations)
- `%LOCALAPPDATA%\MotW\install.log` (Installation)
- `%LOCALAPPDATA%\MotW\uninstall.log` (Uninstallation)

---

### Quick Installation

```powershell
# Run from the scripts directory
.\Install-MotWContext.ps1
```

**Installs:**
- `%USERPROFILE%\Tools\MotW\MotW.ps1`
- Adds `%USERPROFILE%\Tools\MotW` to the user PATH
- Creates **Send To → MotW – Unblock** command (no registry edits)

To remove everything later:
```powershell
.\Uninstall-MotWContext.ps1 -RemoveFiles
```

---

### Manual Installation (Advanced)

If you prefer not to run the installer:

1. Create a folder:
   `C:\Users\<User>\Tools\MotW`
2. Copy `MotW.ps1` into that folder.
3. Add the folder to your **User PATH**:
   _Settings → System → About → Advanced System Settings → Environment Variables → User variables → Path._
4. Optional: add a `.cmd` to `shell:sendto` containing
   ```bat
   @echo off
   powershell.exe -NoLogo -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "%USERPROFILE%\Tools\MotW\MotW.ps1" unblock "%~1"
   ```

---

### Scheduled or Automated Usage

For routine compliance or maintenance, the CLI can be run as a **Scheduled Task** without user interaction:

```powershell
powershell.exe -NoLogo -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass `
  -File "C:\Users\<User>\Tools\MotW\MotW.ps1" unblock "C:\TrustedFiles\*.pdf"
```

Common scenarios:
- Clear MotW from a trusted download folder each night.
- Audit MotW status weekly across a shared directory (`status . -Recurse`).
- Reapply MotW to outbound transfer folders before uploads.

Tasks should run as the logged-in user (not SYSTEM) to ensure the same access context.

## Security Considerations

These tools modify only **NTFS alternate data streams** (`Zone.Identifier`).
They never alter file content or integrity.
Usage should remain limited to trusted environments where restoring preview functionality or removing redundant security prompts does not weaken required security policy.
