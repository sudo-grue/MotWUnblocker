# MotW Unblocker

A Windows utility for viewing, adding, or removing **Mark-of-the-Web (MotW)** metadata on files.

## Overview

When a file is downloaded from the internet, Windows adds a `Zone.Identifier` alternate data stream to mark it as “untrusted.”
This can disable previews and trigger security warnings when opening the file.

**MotW Unblocker** provides a graphical interface to safely inspect and manage this metadata for trusted files.

## Installation

### Pre-built Binaries

Two build variants are available:

| Build Type              | File                    | Description                                                                               |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Self-Contained**      | `MotWUnblocker-sc.exe`  | Includes the .NET runtime. Runs on any Windows 10/11 x64 system with no dependencies.     |
| **Framework-Dependent** | `MotWUnblocker-fdd.exe` | Smaller binary that relies on the machine’s installed **.NET 9 Windows Desktop Runtime**. |

**To use:**
1. Download the desired `.exe` from the [Releases](../../releases) page.
2. Copy it anywhere (e.g., Desktop or Tools folder).
3. Double-click to run — no installation or admin rights required.

### System Requirements

| ----------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| OS          | Windows 10 (21H2+) or Windows 11 x64 | Windows 10 (21H2+) or Windows 11 x64        |
| Runtime     | Bundled                              | Requires `Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 9.x` |

## Developer Information

### Building From Source

#### Restore Dependencies
Before the first build:
```powershell
dotnet restore
```
This downloads any required NuGet packages and generates the project assets file.

#### Build a Single Flavor
```powershell
# Full, self-contained EXE
dotnet publish -c Release -p:PublishFlavor=SelfContained
# → bin\Release\SelfContained\MotWUnblocker-sc.exe

# Small, framework-dependent EXE (uses installed .NET runtime)
dotnet publish -c Release -p:PublishFlavor=FddSingle
# → bin\Release\FddSingle\MotWUnblocker-fdd.exe
```

Each `dotnet publish` automatically performs a restore if needed.

#### Build Both Flavors Together
If you prefer one command for both:
```powershell
dotnet msbuild -t:PublishBoth -p:Configuration=Release
# → bin\Release\SelfContained\MotWUnblocker-sc.exe
# → bin\Release\FddSingle\MotWUnblocker-fdd.exe
```

> **Note:** `dotnet msbuild` does *not* restore automatically, so the `-restore` flag (or a separate `dotnet restore`) is required.

### Technical Specifications
- **Framework:** .NET 9.0
- **UI:** Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)
- **Deployment:** Dual-flavor (Self-Contained + Framework-Dependent)
- **Target Platform:** Windows x64
- **Binary Size:**
  - Self-Contained ≈ 60 MB
  - Framework-Dependent ≈ 176 KB

### Build Configuration Summary
- `PublishTrimmed = false` (WPF-safe)
- `PublishSingleFile = true` for both flavors
- `SelfContained` toggled per flavor
- Optional compression enabled for single-file mode
- Custom MSBuild target **PublishBoth** builds both flavors sequentially
- Each flavor publishes into its own folder (`bin\Release\SelfContained\` and `bin\Release\FddSingle\`)

## Security Considerations

This utility modifies NTFS **alternate data streams** only.
File content and hashes remain unchanged.
Use on trusted files only — removing MotW should never be used to bypass corporate or system security controls.
